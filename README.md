Analysis
- Capomulin and Ramicane are the 2 best performers of the study group. This can be inferred by looking at the summary statistics dataframe.
- Ketapril and Naftisol are the 2 worst performers as you can see in the summary statistics, they have the largest mean and median tumor size but also the largest variance and standard deviation.
- When you drill down to just 1 mouse using Capomulin, you can see the positive affect the drug regimen had in reducing the volume of the tumor.
- When examining the Capomulin drug regimen you can see the very clear correlation between average tumor volume with the weight of th mice. As the mouse weight increases the tumor volume increases in a fairly predictable manner.
